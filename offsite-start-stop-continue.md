# Convene Chicago Offsite — Start / Stop / Continue + Follow-Ups

**Date:** February 2026
**Source:** IC field summary from full-day offsite

---

## Start / Stop / Continue

### START

- **ETC lighting training** (Ion/UTC console programming) — top vote-getter
- **Lift certification** for the team
- **Quarterly feedback sessions** — team to leadership on what leadership can do better
- **Large event production prep** — formal process for bigger shows
- LED management training (pixel math, calibration, processors)
- Audio training beyond Q-SYS/ClearOne (Shure, etc.)
- CATs (cable/wiring diagrams) for all rooms and galleries
- Renovation scoping: involve on-site AV before decisions are made
- LED signage purchase for property needs
- Fiber line solution for hall front-of-house

### STOP

- No AVOS budget at 311 — never allocated
- Roland V-600 switcher at 311 — wrong spec, limited I/O, global HDCP issue, only 2 image memories

### CONTINUE

- Flow sheets / data flows — working but needs standardization
- Better training solicitation process (Dom/Alex acknowledged current approach is weak)
- Best practices for system maintenance and escalation
- Ticket submission discipline — flag early, document fiscal impact
- Content management process for recordings, signage, event materials
- Lasso planning system evaluation (~4-6 weeks out)

## Key Frustrations

- **Airtime was hard to get in the session that mattered most.** The AV breakout moved at Dom's pace — fast, tangent-heavy, favoring whoever interjects. Items I cared about didn't make the board. The post-it system (1 per person) compressed what could be expressed.
- **Rare in-person time was spent being talked at.** ~80% of the day was presentations. Financial reviews, scorecard explanations, sales strategy — all could have been a pre-read. The opportunity cost of using the one day we're all together for one-directional information transfer is enormous.
- **"This is gonna all start with us."** Every operational problem was pushed to the property team to solve first. Eric asked the hardest question of the day — "when does it start going from the top down?" — and the answer was: not yet.
- **Feedback collection has no visible accountability.** Whiteboards were photographed. Post-its were placed. Nothing was assigned a timeline, an owner, or a check-in date. If the ETC training doesn't happen, if the switcher doesn't get replaced — next year's offsite will have the same post-its on the same board.
- **The Courtney moment.** The SVP of Operations delivered cookies, said "I'm gonna leave you to do things I don't understand," and left. The person accountable for operations at the executive level has no technical understanding of what the AV team does.
- **The Decision Tree asks individuals to solve structural problems.** The workshop framed bottlenecks as confidence issues. The AV breakout told a different story: no budget at 311, no planning system, no CATs, no renovation scoping involvement. You can't confidence your way past a missing budget line.

## Follow-Up: Dom

- **Authorized budget redirect** from growth project funds to replace the V-600 switcher (V-80 ~$3K or V-160 ~$5K)
- Wants a **separate meeting with Pollard** to scope fiber for the hall (Analog Way 210 fiber cards, patch panel, conduit runs)
- **Pollard visit to Chicago in March** — room-by-room walkthrough, experience-focused not gear-focused
- Lasso agreement expected in ~4 weeks
- Told team: "ignore you until you get a ticket" — submit everything through helpdesk, include fiscal impact, don't wait to collect months of evidence
- Has **issues with ZV E3 subscription model** but willing to give them until Q4
- Willis hall will NOT go to ZV — stays Analog Way or potentially Barco
- UK hire Craig will start covering early-morning tickets (~7:30 CT)

## Follow-Up: Alex

- Co-facilitated the breakout with Dom
- Acknowledged **training solicitation process is weak** — needs improvement
- Part of the Pollard visit coordination

## Follow-Up: Willis AVOS Team

### This week

- Submit ticket for **lighting relay glitch** (Forum/Hall) — reference previous tickets, note LDG contact quit. Use "Sharpen asked us to do this" for documentation chain
- Forward **ZV feedback doc** (Justin/Garen) to AV helpdesk as formal ticket
- Submit ticket for **311 gallery lighting** iPad/Vibe hub issue
- Submit ticket for **V-600 HDCP toggle** issue
- Confirm all **rental laptops** logged into property O365 accounts

### Next 4-8 weeks

- **Vince, Derek, Jess** to scope the exact switcher replacement model
- Coordinate for **Pollard's March visit**
- ETC lighting training scheduling
- Fiber scoping prep for the hall meeting
